Network Topology Design and Implementation
Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a robust network topology to simulate a scalable and efficient infrastructure. The topology includes routers, switches, VLANs, servers, and end-user devices to provide connectivity, security, and manageability.

Features
Hierarchical Design: Includes core, distribution, and access layers.
Dynamic Routing Protocols: Utilized for scalability and efficient routing.
Redundancy: Implemented using link aggregation and redundant paths for high availability.
VLAN Segmentation: Separate broadcast domains for security and performance.
Firewall Configuration: Secures the network perimeter.
Servers Integration: Includes DNS, DHCP, and other critical network services.
End-User Devices: Simulated client connectivity to ensure end-to-end communication.
Components
Core Layer: Backbone of the network, ensuring high-speed data transfer.
Distribution Layer: Connects core and access layers, implementing policies and routing.
Access Layer: Directly connects end-user devices and VLANs.
Firewalls: Protect network boundaries from external threats.
Servers: Provides essential services like file sharing, domain management, etc.
End Devices: PCs, printers, and other devices simulating a real-world environment.
Objectives
Design: Create a scalable network topology.
Configuration: Configure devices for seamless communication.
Security: Enhance network security using firewalls and VLANs.
Testing: Verify connectivity and functionality across all devices.
Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer: For simulation and configuration.
Routers and Switches: Configured for dynamic routing and VLANs.
Firewalls: Configured for packet filtering and threat prevention.
Key Configurations
VLANs: Multiple VLANs configured for departmental separation.
Dynamic Routing: Protocols like OSPF/EIGRP implemented for routing.
Security Policies: Firewall rules and ACLs for data protection.
Redundancy: Configured using HSRP/VRRP and link redundancy.
Usage
Open the project in Cisco Packet Tracer or the respective simulation tool.
Verify device configurations.
Test connectivity between end devices using ping/traceroute.
Observe routing tables and VLAN memberships.
Conclusion
This project showcases the design and configuration of a highly reliable and secure network topology. It serves as a learning resource for network engineers and enthusiasts to understand the practical application of networking concepts.
